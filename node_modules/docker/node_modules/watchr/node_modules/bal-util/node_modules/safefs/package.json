Open only as many files as the operating system supports\n\n\n## Install\n\n### Backend\n\n1. [Install Node.js](http://bevry.me/node/install)\n2. `npm install --save safefs`\n\n### Frontend\n\n1. [See Browserify](http://browserify.org)\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Example\n\n``` javascript\n// Import\nvar safefs = require('safefs');\n\n// Indicate we're wanting to open a file and reserve our space in the queue\n// If there is space in the pool, our callback will run right away\n// If there isn't space, our callback will fire as soon as there is\nsafefs.openFile(function(){\n\t// We just got some available space, lets do our stuff with the file\n\trequire('fs').writeFileSync('some-file', 'data')\n\t// Once we're done, indicate it, so that other tasks can swim in the pool too\n\tsafefs.closeFile();\n});\n\n// If we're working with an asynchronous function, it'll look like this\nsafefs.openFile(function(){\n\trequire('fs').writeFile('some-file', 'data', function(err){\n\t\tsafefs.closeFile();\n\t});\n});\n// as we only want to close file once we are completely done with it\n\n// However, that's pretty annoying have to wrap all our calls in openFile and closeFile\n// so it's a good thing that safefs provides wrappers for all the asynchronous fs methods for us\n// allowing us to just do\nsafefs.writeFile('some-file', 'data', function(err){\n\t// all done\n});\n// which will open and close the spot in the pool for us automatically, yay!\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n\nArguments suffixed with `?` are optional.\n\n- Custom methods:\n\t- `openFile(next)`\n\t- `closeFile()`\n\t- `getParentPathSync(path)`\n\t- `ensurePath(path, options?, next)` - will attempt to ensure the path exists, options:\n\t\t- `mode` - defaults to `null`\n- Wrapped fs/path methods:\n\t- `readFile(path, options?, next)`\n\t- `writeFile(path, data, options?, next)` - will also attempt to ensure the path exists\n\t- `appendFile(path, data, options?, next)` - will also attempt to ensure the path exists\n\t- `mkdir(path, mode?, next)` - mode defaults to `0o777 & (~process.umask())`\n\t- `stat(path, next)`\n\t- `readdir(path, next)`\n\t- `unlink(path, next)`\n\t- `rmdir(path, next)`\n\t- `exists(path, next)`\n\t- `existsSync(path)`\n\n\n\n### Notes\n\n- You should call `openFile` before and `afterFile` after ALL file system interaction\n- To make this possible, we maintain the following globals:\n\t- `numberOfOpenFiles` - defaults to `0`\n\t- `maxNumberOfOpenFiles` - defaults to `process.env.NODE_MAX_OPEN_FILES` if available, otherwise sets to `100`\n\t- `waitingToOpenFileDelay` - defaults to `100`\n\n\n\n## History\nYou can discover the history inside the [History.md](https://github.com/bevry/safefs/blob/master/History.md#files) file\n\n\n\n## License\nLicensed under the incredibly [permissive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence) [MIT License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/MIT/)\n<br/>Copyright © 2013+ [Bevry Pty Ltd](http://bevry.me)\n<br/>Copyright © 2011-2012 [Benjamin Arthur Lupton](http://balupton.com)\n",
